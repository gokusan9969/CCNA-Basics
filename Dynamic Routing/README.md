# Dynamic Routing

A dynamic routing table is created, maintained, and updated by a routing protocol running on the router.

Example-(RIP, EIGRP, OSPF, IGRP)

There are two type of dynamic Routing Protocol
-	Distance-vector routing Protocol
-	Link-state routing Protocol

Example of distance vector routing protocol (RIP, IGRP)

Example of link state Routing Protocol (RIP2, OSPF, IS-IS)

EIGRP both distance-vector and link state routing Protocol
