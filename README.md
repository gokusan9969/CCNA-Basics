# NETWORKING DEVICES

Repeaters
-	Operate at Physical Layer of the OSI model
-	Reshape the weak signal
-	Connect two segments of the same LAN

Hubs
-	Simplest and low cost device
-	Also known as Multi-port Repeater
-	Operate at Physical Layer like Repeater
-	Data transfer to all the ports

-	Hub types:
	Active hub – Provides signal regeneration
	Passive hub – No signal regeneration
	Intelligent hub – Provides management of each port

Bridges
-	Layer 2 devices as works at Data Link Layer of the OSI model
-	Interconnect multiple LANs and manages data flow

Switches
-	Provide signal flow management
-	Replace slower hub
-	Being a Data Link Layer device uses MAC address for data transfer
-	Data transfer to specific port

Routers
-	Operate at Network Layer of the OSI model
-	Can connect nearer or far network segments
-	Decide the best route with the help of network layer address
-	Responsible for Source to Destination delivery of packet

Route types:
-	Static route – Routing tables are manually configured
-	Dynamic route – Routing tables are automatically configured
